<h1>Preprocessor</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>The preprocessor is a tool that is used before the source code is compiled to perform tasks such as including header files, defining macros and removing comments.

The preprocessor is an integral part of the C compiler and its purpose is to process the source code before it is compiled by the actual compiler. The preprocessor takes the original source code and performs changes and manipulations on it before it is compiled. This includes expanding macros, including header files and removing comments.

The preprocessor runs automatically before the source code is compiled and is used to perform specific tasks that are necessary before compilation. In general, the C preprocessor is used to make code easier to maintain, easier to read and easier to understand.</p>
