<h1>Functions, nested loops</h1>

<h2>what are the function?</h2>

<p>They are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow a program to be broken down into smaller, modular parts, making the code more readable, easier to understand and maintain.</p>

<h2>What are the nested loops?</h2>

<p>They are loops that are inside other loops. They allow a series of instructions to be repeated several times, and are often used to traverse and manipulate multidimensional data structures.</p>
