<h1>Singly linked lists</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>It is a linear data structure consisting of nodes that are linked together by pointers. Each node contains two parts: the first part is a piece of data that can be of any type and the second part is a pointer that points to the next node in the list.

In a simple linked list, the first node is called the "head" or "start" of the list and the last node points to a NULL value indicating the end of the list. Inserting and deleting elements in a simple linked list can be done efficiently in constant time, since only pointers to adjacent nodes need to be updated.</p>
