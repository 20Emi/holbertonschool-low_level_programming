<h1>Pointers, arrays and strings</h1>

<h2>What are pointers?</h2>

<p>A pointer is a variable that contains the memory address of another variable. Pointers are used in C to access dynamic memory, to pass arguments by reference in functions and to manipulate complex data structures.</p>

<h2>What are arrays?</h2>

<p>A data structure that stores a set of elements of the same type. In C, arrays are defined with a data type and length, and can be accessed through a numeric index that represents the position of the element in the array.
</p>

<h2>What are strings?</h2>

<p>Character strings are arrays of characters that represent a sequence of characters terminated by a null character ('0'). In C, character strings can be declared as character arrays, and can be manipulated by a number of library functions.</p>
