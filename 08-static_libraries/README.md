<h1>Static libraries</h1>

<h2>What are Static libraries?</h2>

<p>They are a set of compiled and linked functions in a library file that can be linked to a program at compile time. The functions are copied into the final executable of the program during the linking process and this allows the code to be reused in multiple programs without having to recompile the functions in each program.</p>
