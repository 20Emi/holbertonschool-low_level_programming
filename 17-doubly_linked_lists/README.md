<h1>Doubly linked lists</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>It is a linear data structure in which each element of the list contains two links: one to the previous element and one to the next one. This feature makes it possible to traverse the list in both directions: from the beginning to the end and vice versa.

In a doubly linked list, each list item, in addition to containing the value to be stored, also contains two pointers or references: one to the previous (previous) item and one to the next (next) item in the list. The first element of the list (head) has its previous pointer set to NULL, and the last element (tail) has its next pointer set to NULL.

A doubly linked list can be used in situations where it is necessary to access list elements in both directions, since the structure allows fast and efficient access to both forward and backward elements.</p>
