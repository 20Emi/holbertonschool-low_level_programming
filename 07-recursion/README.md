<h1>Recursion</h1>

<h2>What is recursion?</h2>

<p>It is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to perform a given task.
To implement recursion, a function that calls itself within its own body is defined. The function must include a termination condition to prevent the recursion from executing indefinitely. In general, the termination condition is defined as a "basis" for the problem you are trying to solve.</p>
