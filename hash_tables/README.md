<h1>hash tables</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>hash table is a data structure used to store and retrieve data efficiently. A hash table consists of an array of elements, where each element is a linked list. Each element in the linked list contains a key and a value. The key is used to calculate an index into the array using a hash function, which transforms the key into an integer. This integer is used as an index to access the corresponding element in the array.</p>
